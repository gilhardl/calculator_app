# Calculator application

A simple Flutter application with basic calculator features to demonstrate how Flutter testing works.

This Flutter application only includes some widgets for UI. So the application's `test` folder contains only widget tests and integration tests.

Application logic is deported into the `calculator` Dart package. So unit tests are in the package too.

This project was developped using the Very Good Venture course :
